# The Trolls
These are a little collection of some java programs that I made that you can use to troll your friends with. They may be chinese or need fixing, if so just make a pull request. :trollface:


hause (convict): your honor, i did not skid my code!

fencingf(member of jury): LIAR!

perry(judge): order, order in the court!

aestheticall(witness testifying): your honor, as you can clearly see from the one string that looks oddly similar to mine, he has in fact skidded my whole program

perry: is this true hause?

hause: the string is a command that is the same across all systems

fencingf: you code looks VERY similar to a post on stack overflow

perry: where did you get your code from hause?

hause: i did not skid a single line of code from any of you guys, i just got help on stackoverflow!

perry: what do you think aestheticall?

aestheticall: he still pasted my code!

hause: my code style is completely different from yours! im a dumb guy i probably wouldn't have removed all the this.'s everywhere!

fencingf: your code is still trash!

hause: i have a different code style, and just because it's not yours dosen't mean its trash!!

perry: order! order in the court!

aestheticall: well, what are we supposed to do then your honor?

perry: i see no further reason to continue this case. hausemaster B issue has skidded his code!!!!

*crowd goes booo*

perry: get him outta here!

*hause get's taken away in handcuffs*

fencingf, perry, aestheticall chant: skidder! skidder! skidder!

*skidder fades out*

the end

**_You can skid and paste these into whatever you want I do not care_**.
